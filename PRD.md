# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name:** Claude Agent Studio (codename: `forge`)  
**Target Audience:** Developers using Claude CLI for AI-powered software development, prototyping, and codebase management.  
**Core Value Proposition:** A desktop wrapper for Claude CLI that enables multi-agent orchestration while maintaining developer ownership of their Claude access, tokens, and codebase.

---

## **1. Overview**

Claude Agent Studio is a desktop application that provides a powerful UI wrapper around the Claude Code CLI and SDK, enabling developers to create, configure, manage, and run multiple AI programming agents. Unlike cloud-based solutions, it maintains developer sovereignty by using their own Claude CLI installation and access tokens. The application leverages the Claude Code TypeScript SDK for programmatic control while orchestrating multiple agent instances in isolated environments. This allows developers to work on different parts of their codebase simultaneously with advanced features like Model Context Protocol (MCP) extensions, structured message streaming, and conversation management—all while maintaining full control over their data, tokens, and development workflow.

---

## **2. Vision & Goals**

### Primary Goals
- Provide a powerful UI wrapper for Claude CLI while maintaining developer ownership
- Enable parallel Claude CLI instances for faster development and A/B testing
- Create a local-first environment where developers control their Claude access and tokens
- Orchestrate multiple CLI sessions with intelligent context and workspace management
- Support both synchronous interaction and background task execution
- Zero vendor lock-in: developers can always fall back to using Claude CLI directly

### Success Metrics
- Time reduction in feature development (target: 50%+ for routine tasks)
- Number of parallel agents effectively managed (target: 5-10 per project)
- Developer satisfaction with agent-generated code quality
- Reduction in context switching overhead

## **12. Open Questions for Discussion**

1. **Business Model**: Since users pay Anthropic directly for Claude CLI access, how should Forge be monetized? Open source? Paid licenses? Support contracts?
2. **Claude CLI Requirements**: Minimum CLI version? Handle missing CLI gracefully? Auto-detect installation?
3. **Integration Priority**: Which IDEs/tools to support first beyond VS Code?
4. **Agent Persistence**: Store conversation history locally? Export/import agent sessions?
5. **Multi-User Support**: Share agent configurations without sharing Claude access?
6. **CLI Compatibility**: Support other CLI tools (GitHub Copilot CLI, etc.) in future?
7. **Update Strategy**: Auto-detect Claude CLI updates? Version compatibility matrix?
